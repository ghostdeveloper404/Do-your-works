### Issue: Fix the Task Deletion Bug

#### Description

There is a known issue where deleting a task doesn't always update the task list correctly. Sometimes the task appears to be deleted but reappears after a page refresh.

#### Steps to Reproduce

1. Add a few tasks.
2. Delete a task.
3. Refresh the page.
4. Observe that the deleted task reappears.

#### Possible Solution

The issue likely lies in the way tasks are being updated in LocalStorage. A fresh pair of eyes might catch the bug!

# React + Vite


This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
